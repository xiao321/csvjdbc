Instructions for creating a CsvJdbc release build/RELEASE-INSTRUCTIONS.txt

1. Check environment

java -version (must be 1.6)

2. Checkout (replace simoc with your SourceForge username)

git clone ssh://simoc@git.code.sf.net/p/csvjdbc/code csvjdbc-code
git clone ssh://simoc@git.code.sf.net/p/csvjdbc/website csvjdbc-website

3.  Check that XML <property name="rel"> tag in file
csvjdbc-code/build/build.xml is the version number we are creating.
If not, update it and commit.

4. Compile

cd csvjdbc-code/build
ant jar test

5. Check that the ant test step above does not report failing unit tests

6. Upload to Sourceforge web site (replace simoc and 1.0-29 with values
for this release).

sftp simoc,csvjdbc@frs.sourceforge.net
cd /home/frs/project/c/cs/csvjdbc/CsvJdbc
mkdir 1.0-29
cd 1.0-29
put target/csvjdbc-1.0-29.jar

7.  Check that XML <project><version> tag in file pom.xml is the version
number we are creating plus "-SNAPSHOT" suffix. If not, update it and
commit.

8. Check that you have a $HOME/.m2/settings.xml file containing
the following XML tags, as described in
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html
and that the GPG profile contains a GPG key created using steps in
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html

<server><id>git.code.sf.net</id> ...
<server><id>ossrh</id> ...
<profile><id>ossrh</id> ... contains GPG profile

9. Maven deploy to Maven Central

mvn release:clean release:prepare
(accept defaults at prompts for CsvJdbc version, git tag, next CsvJdbc

mvn release:perform

10. Login to Nexus Repository Manager https://oss.sonatype.org/
(username and password same as in <ossrh> XML tag in
